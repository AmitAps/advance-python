"""
Take a closer look at that last call to next(). You can see that execution has blown up with a
traceback. This is because generators, like all iterators, can be exhausted. Unless your
generator is infinite, you can iterate through it one time only. Once all values have been
evaluated, iteration will stop and the for loop will exit. If you used next(),
then instead youâ€™ll get an explicit StopIteration exception.
